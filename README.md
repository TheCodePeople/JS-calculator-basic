# Calculator Task Instructions

In this task, you will create a basic calculator using JavaScript that performs four basic calculation operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will take two numbers and an operation as input and display the result in the browser. We will use a simple HTML file to observe the output.

## Step 1: Set Up HTML File
1. Create a new HTML file named "index.html".
2. Inside the HTML file, set up a basic structure with the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
3. Add a script tag inside the `<body>` to link your JavaScript code.

## Step 2: Create JavaScript File
1. Create a new JavaScript file named "calculator.js" and link it to the HTML file using the script tag.
2. Inside "calculator.js," define four functions for each of the basic calculation operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
3. Each function should take two parameters (numbers) and return the result of the corresponding operation.

## Step 3: Take User Input
1. In "calculator.js," use the `prompt` function to take user input for the first number, the operation, and the second number.
2. The user will see three prompts:
   - Prompt 1: Enter the first number.
   - Prompt 2: Enter the operation (+, -, *, or /).
   - Prompt 3: Enter the second number.
3. Ensure the user enters valid numeric values for the numbers and a supported operation for the operation prompt.

## Step 4: Perform Calculation
1. Based on the user's input for the operation, call the appropriate function (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, or `divide`) with the given numbers.
2. Store the result in a variable.

## Step 5: Display the Result
1. Use the `alert` function to display the result of the calculation to the user in the browser.

## Step 6: Test
1. Open the "index.html" file in your web browser.
2. The browser will prompt you to enter the first number, the operation (+, -, *, or /), and the second number.
3. After you provide the input, the browser will display the result of the calculation in an alert box.

Feel free to experiment and extend the functionality of your calculator. Test different calculations and verify that the results are correct. Have fun coding!
